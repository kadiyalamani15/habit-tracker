A habit tracker application created during the Online MOOC Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python. The app allows users to track their habits by adding them to the app. Once a habit is completed, users can mark it as completed. The user's activity is displayed in a date-wise manner where the user can select the date, and the tracker data of that particular date would be visible.
